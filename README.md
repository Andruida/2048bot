#### This is a basic 2048 game on the chat.

#### But what is 2048?
> 2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.

You can control the numbers by using the given reactions accordingly.  
You can play it while you're waiting for your friend to return from his journey to the fridge, or while you're watching a loading screen. Its a neat little game, and from now on it can be played anywhere, anytime, on Discord.
